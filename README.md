# PassPasteHapi
This is a simple app that experiments with using Hapi has an api backend for React. 

The goal of the project is to have a user be able to post a new pastebin with a password to protect their paste. 
A different user can then find their paste and view it if they have the given password and paste id/url.

Data is persisted in mongoDB

This project is helping me experiment with/learn:
1) Hapi for creating apis
2) React front end
3) MongoDB
4) Encrypting passwords/user data
